- [Incompatible change] JBASE was renamed to JAIL_BASE.

- ${.PARSEDIR} is added to .include lines in Makefile.inc.
  This should be no-op in most cases.

- The standard directory structure is changed so that SITE/HOST
  has 'root' for the root directory when one or more jails are used
  on the same host.  See also example.org/base/{root,jail.ns} for more
  specifics.
